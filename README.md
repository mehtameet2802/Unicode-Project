# Unicode-Project
Hi I am Meet Mehta and have created Unicode-Project repository for my Unicode inteview.

Task 1 folder has files for a java project of library managaement system which allows the user to login in the system, add new books, issue books to students, take books back from student and to search which book has been issued by which student using their name and id and same can be done for searching using bookname and id. It also restricts user from issuing more than 1 book to the student. I have used the logic of arralist for this project.

Login id is - Teacher123

Login password is - init@123

Data for few books and students has been already coded by me which includes

Book data
1 Book Name - Physics, Book Id - 1

2 Book Name - Chemistry, Book Id - 2
3 Book Name - Maths, Book Id - 3
4 Book Name - Bio, Book Id - 4
5 Book Name - Computer Programming, Book Id - 5
6 Book Name - Java, Book Id - 6
7 Book Name - Python, Book Id - 7
8 Book Name - Machine Learning, Book Id - 8

Student data
1 Student name A , Student id 20
2 Student name B , Student id 21
3 Student name C , Student id 22

Task 2,3,4 folder has files for a multiscreen app called Contactz, it has been developed by me in java and allows user to save name,number,email id and birthdate of any person by clicking on save button.User can use clear button to clear the inout fields. The app allows the user to view all the saved contacts by clicking on all contacts button and details of the contact can be seen by clicking on the info icon, calls can be made and messages can be sent to the respective person by clicking on call and message icon.

For all the tasks I have taken help from youtube and stack overflow and also did a small guided project.
